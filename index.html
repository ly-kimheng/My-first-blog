    <h1> The Scent of Nostalgia
    </h1>
    <p class="p1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A scent</b>  has its own belonging, sometimes it can be a person,
            a place or  it can be your favorite home-cooked meals. Yet, it’s funny how the scents
            can unexpectedly bring you back to the past, unlocking the memory of your childhood 
            you hadn’t thought of in years, Sometimes those sudden wave of emotion can be triggered 
            by something as simple as a stranger’s perfume, the smells of rain or foods as you walk by.
